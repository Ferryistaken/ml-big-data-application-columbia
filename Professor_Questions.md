# Questions

On the last day of the course, the professor decided to host a full day Q&A session, these are my questions:

- Do you think that the stock market can actually be predicted by neural networks? If a neural network were to work, then it would be overused and get priced in in the market.
	- Only for some time, because after it it will get priced in.
- What career path would you take if you had our age and were interested in data science, coding, and the stock market?
	-  Didn't ask.
- Where do you find the articles that you were talking about during these weeks?
	- **Towardsdatascience** (Medium) [Jesus Rodriguez, Eryk Lewinson], but only choose the articles with source and code, since tds is not peer reviewed.
	- **Paperswithcode.com** is a good place to learn (go on method and find domain)
	- **Neurips.cc**, one of the top journals for modern day AI
	- **AQR.com** for finance
	- **Rstudio AI Blog** for R related content.
	- **Arxiv.org** for papers in any field
	- People (Find papers on google scholar):
		- **Yoshua Bengio**
		- **Geoffrey hinton**
		- **Yann Lecun**
		- **Kenneth R. French**
- Books/other resources that you would recommend on this topic (data science, finance)
	-  John H. Cochrane, Asset Pricing Theory
	-  Uni of Chicago
- What do you think of ETFs like $BUZZ
	- Initial stock pool

Recommend start with big companies first
Recommend collect data for yourself

Try audio and natural langauge processing models with stock market

Do CS as major, don't do 2 major or do minors, just do an internship or develop something and sell it.

Take classes:
- Algorithmic design
- Optimization

Extra Resources:
-   John Cochrane book in Asset Pricing: [https://yiqiaoyin.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/asset-pricing-j-cochrane.pdf](https://yiqiaoyin.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/asset-pricing-j-cochrane.pdf)
-   Our course github repo has a section for books and online tutorials: [https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/Introduction-to-Machine-Learning-Big-Data-and-Application#resources-and-references](https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/Introduction-to-Machine-Learning-Big-Data-and-Application#resources-and-references)
-   I read news in AI Blog (R focused): [https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/](https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/)
-   Cornel Arxiv provides sources for papers (published, preprint, or unpublished all online): [https://arxiv.org/](https://arxiv.org/)
-   Sometimes software-wise: I read some tensorflow examples [https://www.tensorflow.org/](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
-   For more coding related to new algorithms or datasets, Paperwithcode is a good resource: [https://paperswithcode.com/](https://paperswithcode.com/)
-   Here is a big conference Neurips and I read papers up here too: [https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/)
-   For finance (asset pricing) related, I recommend: [https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Datasets](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Datasets)
-   Anybody that has papers: I would recommend Google scholar to subscribe to new papers: [https://scholar.google.co.uk/schhp?hl=en](https://scholar.google.co.uk/schhp?hl=en)
